This is a Work-In-Progress Game engine that is built upon SFML as the base.

It does not use an ECS system or any other such established methods as i wanted to make an engine without knowing anything and learning along the way.

It can be used currently in a limited fashion to build some games.

Examples of some games will be posted here at a later time.
