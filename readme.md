# Codename TE

The purpose of this project is **NOT** to develop a game but instead to develop an **Engine** in SFML while learning to make games. 

With each additional Iteration/Phase of the Game/Project newer systems/managers will be added to the engine till we have a decent engine that can be robustly be used to develop games both simple and complex.
